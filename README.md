# Smple

Smple is my pet programming language. I am making it because I want to
learn how to make compilers / interpreters. I am not sure currently what this will become or 
where this will go so if you can contribute that would be quite helpful.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'smple'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install smple

## Usage

I don't really know as of now.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
